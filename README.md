Lazy Files Gradle Plugin
========================

Have a private project?

Need to upload binaries, reports from CI server?

No ability to setup dedicated server?

Use your DropBox account for any of your goals!

**Lazy Files** help you with this.

# Limitations

1. Only Gradle plugin currently available, *but you can* help this project by adding something else.
2. It's not a Maven repository over DropBox, *but you can* easily reach your goals in a similar way.
3. It's not a dependency resolving system, *but you can* simplify development with your own conventions.

# How to use it?

1. Include it like a dependency to your buildscript:

    ```
    buildscript {
        dependencies {
            classpath 'com.shamanland:lazy-files:0.1.1'
        }
    }
    ```

2. Apply plugin to any project or sub-project:

    ```
    apply plugin: 'lazy-files'
    ```

3. Configure items for uploading:

    ```
    lazyFiles {
        uploadFile new File(projectDir, 'build/libs/my-lib-0.1.jar'), new File('/my-project/my-lib-0.1.jar')
        // uploadFile new File('/absolute/path/to/local.file'), new File('/dropbox/path/to/remote.file')
    }
    ```

4. Configure items for fetching:

    ```
    lazyFiles {
        fetchFile new File(projectDir, 'build/libs/my-lib-0.1.jar'), new File('/my-project/my-lib-0.1.jar')
        // fetchFile new File('/dropbox/path/to/remote.file'), new File('/absolute/path/to/local.file')
    }
    ```

5. Invoke corresponding gradle tasks:

    ```
    gradlew uploadLazyFiles
    gradlew fetchLazyFiles
    ```

# How to authenticate?

1. There is built-in gradle task, invoke it and follow instructions in order to get access token:

    ```
    gradlew loginLazyFiles
    ```
    
    Once you finish this step, access token will be saved in your home directory (`~/.lazy-files/app.properties`).
    
    You can use different accounts for different projects, they will be stored using SHA1 of project absolute path. 

2. You can specify access token manually:

    At first run task from previous step with the argument `--info`, then you will see the following output:
    
    ```
    DropBox access token retrieved: AAAAAAAA
    ```
    
    Now you can place this token into `build.gradle`:
    
    ```
    lazyFiles {
        dropboxAccessToken = 'AAAAAAAA'
    }
    ```

# Security

Be careful sharing access token with someone else or saving it in repository.
Anyone can use it without any additional authentication like you.

But usually it's not a problem if your project is completely private.
You may commit this access token to VCS, then anyone from your team won't be required to authenticate again.
